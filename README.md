ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Mantvydas, a Software Systems student at Kaunas University of Technology (KTU). I'm passionate about exploring the world of software development and solving real-world problems through technology.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm diving deep into various programming languages, software architecture, and development methodologies to build robust and scalable software systems. I'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies to expand my skill set.

ðŸ’» On GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from web applications to mobile apps, and everything in between. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and enjoy contributing to projects that align with my interests and values.

ðŸ”§ Some of my areas of interest include:
- Software Engineering
- Full-stack Development
- DevOps and CI/CD
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- IoT applications

ðŸš€ When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, reading tech blogs, or participating in hackathons and coding competitions. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community through blog posts and tech talks.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mantvydasdeltuva/). I'm always open to collaborations, mentorship opportunities, or just a friendly chat about all things tech!
